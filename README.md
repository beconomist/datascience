Inline code has back-ticks around it. For example, `git clone` is used to make a clone of remote repo in local directory. It will automatically creates a directory with the same name of the repo and then creates a `.git` directory within it. It then will pull all the files onto the local repo.

Blocks of code are either "fenced" by lines with three back-ticks, or are indented with four spaces. The fence approach is better since it supports *syntax highlighting*, for example:

```javascript
var s = 'some-string';
alert(s);
```
